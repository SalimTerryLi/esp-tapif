# TAP Interface example & component

*Note: Makefile support is dropped as will be officially dropped when V5.0 is out*

Tested on IDF V4.3 or later

This is an implementation of a simple TAP interface for ESP-IDF, which will enable flexible software-based Ethernet data channel to be used with existing IP layer application, such as Bluetooth BNEP

The root directory contains an example to show how to use the API, and the standalone component is in `components/esp-tapif` subdirectory.
